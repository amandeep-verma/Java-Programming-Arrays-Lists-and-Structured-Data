Assignment 1: Most Frequent Word -You will write a program to determine the word that occurs the most often in a file. If more than one word occurs as the most often, then return the first such word found. You should make all words lowercase before counting them. Thus, “This” and “this” will both be counted as the lowercase version of “this”. You should not consider punctuation, so “end” and “end,” will be considered different words.


Assignment 2: Character Names -Write a program to determine the characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays that have the most speaking parts. Consider the play “The Tragedy of Macbeth” in the file macbeth.txt. Write a program to print out the main characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays, those with the most speaking parts. You should identify a speaking part by reading the file line-by-line and finding the location of the first period on the line. Then you will assume that everything up to the first period is the name of a character and count how many times that occurs in the file. You will only print those characters that appear more often than others.
